> 
> ### 1. Accessing ArgoCD UI
> To access the ArgoCD UI, you need to port forward to the ArgoCD server:
> 
> ```
> kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
> ```
> 
> Then, open your browser and navigate to https://localhost:8080. Log in using the default credentials (username: admin, password: password).
> 
> ### 2. Deploying Applications with ArgoCD
> ArgoCD deploys applications based on Git repositories. Define an application in a Git repository, and ArgoCD will automatically sync and deploy it.
> 
> ### 3. Managing Applications with ArgoCD CLI
> ArgoCD provides a command-line interface for managing applications. 
> 
> For example:
> ```
> List applications:
> argocd app list
> 
> Sync an application:
> argocd app sync [APP_NAME]
> 
> Delete an application:
> argocd app delete [APP_NAME]
> ```
> 
> ### 4. Declarative Application Configuration
> Define your application in a declarative manner using an Application CRD or a YAML file. This serves as the source of truth for your application state.
> 
> ### 5. ArgoCD Rollback
> ArgoCD supports rollbacks in case of issues with a deployed application:
> 
> ```
> argocd app rollback [APP_NAME]
> ```
> 
> ### 5. Verifying ArgoCD Installation
> Check the status of the ArgoCD components:
> 
> ```
> kubectl get all -n argocd
> ```
> 
> This should display the pods, services, and other components related to ArgoCD.
